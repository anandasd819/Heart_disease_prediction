# Heart_disease_prediction
This is a real-time heart or cardiovascular disease prediction system which I have developed during my SOFTWARE-PROJECT-VI course. Please use the dataset from here (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sulianova/cardiovascular-disease-dataset) if you interested about this. Instead of saving the machine learning algorithm, I have trained the model in main.py file. Here I am sharing some images of the application for your visualization.
